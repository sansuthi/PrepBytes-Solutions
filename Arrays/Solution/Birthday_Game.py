# Birthday Game
'''
Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much and she wants to share a chocolate bar 
with him in which each of the squares consists of an integer represented by A[i]. She decides to share a contiguous 
segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month M and the sum 
of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday D. You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

Input Format
The first line consists of an integer N which denotes the number of squares in the chocolate bar.       
The second line consists of N space-separated integers A[i], consisting of numbers on the chocolate bar squares.        
The third line contains an integer D and M which denotes Yatharth's birthday and his birth month respectively.    

Output Format
Print an integer denoting the total number of ways that Anamika can partition her chocolate bar to share with Yatharth.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 90
1 <= A[i] <= 5
1 <= D <= 31
1 <= M <= 12

Example
Input
5
2 2 1 3 2
4 2

Output
2

Explanation
Anamika wants to find segments summing to Yatharth's birthday, D=4 with a length matching his birth month, M=2. 
In this case, two segments are meeting her criteria: [2,2] and [1,3].
