# Ten from Two
'''
OMG! You made up to this question, Congrats for that! Let us solve a fun maths question now. 
Just do the simple calculation behind it and you are done. You are given a number n and you are 
asked to make n divisible by 10. The only operation you can do on n is to multiply n by 2.  Given
n find out how many operations are required to make n divisible by 10.

Input format
First-line contains an integer T, denoting number of test cases. Then follows T test cases. Each test 
case consists of a single variable n.

Output format
Print T values. Each line will print number of operations(0 or more) if it is possible to make n divisible by 
10 else print −1.

Constraints
. 1 <= T <= 5
. 1 <= N < 50

Example
Input:
2
10
25

Output:
0
1

Sample Test case Explanation
In the first test case, n=10 is already divisible by 10 so the number of operations performed = 0.
In the second test case, n=25 will be divisible by 10 after multiplying n by 2 once. 25∗2=50 and 50 is 
divisible by 10.

for _ in range(int(input())):
  num, i = int(input()), 0
  while i != 10 and num % 10 != 0:
    num *= 2 
    i += 1 
  print(-1) if i==10 else print(i)
